# My assorted scripts

This is simply a collection of my various scrips that I use to make my life easier.

I've decided to make a repo so I can use them on different machines without hassle.

## [Get Git Stale Branches](https://github.com/OddKMS/get-git-stale-branches)

Git submodule from https://github.com/OddKMS/get-git-stale-branches.
Goes through a repository and spits out a file containing the stale branches on origin.

## [Gifencode](/gifencode/)

Uses ffmpeg to create a palette of a movie clip and then makes a gif using said palette.
This is to get a better result than simply converting the movie to .gif because of the
formats limitation. Without the palette, the gif will have some ugly artifacts due to
colour compression

## [Turn On Keep Awake](/turn-on-keep-awake/)

VBS Script to turn on the KeepAwake functionality in [Microsoft PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys), and keep it on until my workday is over.
